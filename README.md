Communication Plan
Communication Formats After Hours and On Weekend:

Slack
Trello for file sharing, To Do lists
Communication in the code:

Go way overkill on the comments. Comment at every single line getting started.
Group Working Hours

9am – 6pm group time
8am- 9:15pm be aware group member(s) may need to communicate after group time
Strategy for Making Sure Voices are Heard (within a safe environment)

Three a day check-in meetings
Morning meeting - 9am start time – debrief, code review and prep for day
After lunch – 1pm start time – review the morning, re-check in, and brainstorm as needed for afternoon.
Before leaving for the day – 5:30pm? How the morning and afternoon went
General Guidelines:

Code review occurs at each meetups
Be patient and kind with each other.
Suggestion: Start sentences with “I need...”
There are no bad ideas
Failure will happen and it’s okay! We do this thing together.
If we’re moving too fast:

Person who is slower - speak up! Fast coders can slow down.
Person who is coding fast may need to take a break and help person catch up.
Conflict Resolution Plan
Process to resolve conflicts

Everyone stops coding
Return to communication ground rules.
Try to understand the conflict
Come to mutual agreement without taking sides
Find a compromise between the two intersecting viewpoints
Discuss things and find happy place
When conflict is resolved, mandatory 10 minute break to relax.
How to raise concerns to members not adequately contributing

First step: Find out why the person is falling behind, without judgement.
Put out the invitation to share - if something else outside of project is going on, preventing the person from being present, etc.
During briefs in morning, check in with each other with how they’re doing with a task.
Honesty from each of us about assigned tasks.
Ask for help when needed.
How and when to escalate conflict when attempts are unsuccessful:

If person is unwilling to talk through or unwilling to improve. They may be going through the motions, but not contributing, not willing to work on issue, and not willing to reach out.
Escalation will involve reaching out to Boss and HR (Lena and Ron).
